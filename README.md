# dog-bark-classifier

Goal: categorize types of dog barks. 

TODO: everything.

## Data Collection

I used Google's AudioSet to get the different types of dog barks
- [Bark](https://research.google.com/audioset/ontology/bark_1.html): these are communicative barks.
- [Whimper](https://research.google.com/audioset/ontology/whimper_dog_1.html): these barks are used to communicate fear or pain.
- [Yip](https://research.google.com/audioset/ontology/yip_1.html): higher pitched bark or cry
- [Howl](https://research.google.com/audioset/ontology/howl_1.html): longer cries
- [Growl](https://research.google.com/audioset//dataset/growling.html): used for anger, agression, or warning.
- [Bow Wow](https://research.google.com/audioset/ontology/bowwow_1.html): a more tonal communicative bark.

I found an [ontology json](https://github.com/audioset/ontology/blob/master/ontology.json) to get a list of all urls.
